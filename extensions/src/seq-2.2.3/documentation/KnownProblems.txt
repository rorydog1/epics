Known Problems
==============

.. _Known_Problems_2.2.2:

Known Problems in Release 2.2.2
-------------------------------

* Attempting to issue a DEFAULT pvPut when an ASYNC put is already
  pending on the same variable leads to an assertion failure.

.. _Known_Problems_2.2.1:

Known Problems in Release 2.2.1
-------------------------------

* In test/validate, pvAssignStress.st has the same program name as
  pvAssignSubst.st, leading to build errors when cross-compiling to VxWorks
  or RTEMS, where all tests get linked into a single library. This can be
  fixed by changing the program name in pvAssignStress.st to
  "pvAssignStressTest".

* A previous bugfix in the pvAssign builtin introduced a regression, that
  can lead to assertion failures.

* A wrong assertion in the CA event handler may be triggered when connection
  to a PV is lost in the middle of a pending get request.

* When exiting from a program, deadlock is possible when a pending callback
  is active when the program shuts down.

* Tests fail in tests/compiler if the build host has an ancient version of
  Test::More that does not support subtest. This happens e.g. on RHEL 6.6.

* Dependency generation in src/snc is broken if compiled against base-3.15
  due to a bug in the Makefile (and one in base).

* Building static libraries fails due to wrong order of dependent libraries
  in two Makefiles.

* Building on Windows can fail due to missing epicsShare stuff in seq_snc.h.
